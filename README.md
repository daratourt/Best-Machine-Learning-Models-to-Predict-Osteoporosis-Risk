# Effectiveness of Significant Feature Selection and Oversampling Techniques in Osteoporosis Risk Prediction
## Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to predict the risk of osteoporosis in patients using a dataset of patients' medical records. Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture. The condition is more common in older people, particularly women.

## About the dataset
The dataset offers comprehensive information on health factors influencing osteoporosis development, including demographic details, lifestyle choices, medical history, and bone health indicators. It aims to facilitate research in osteoporosis prediction, enabling machine learning models to identify individuals at risk. Analyzing factors like age, gender, hormonal changes, and lifestyle habits can help improve osteoporosis management and prevention strategies.
