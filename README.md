# Best Machine Learning Models to Predict Osteoporosis Risk
## Project Overview
Osteoporosis is a severe condition characterized by weakened bones, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Early prediction and diagnosis can help in managing and preventing the condition, thereby improving the quality of life for at-risk individuals, particularly older women. This study aims to identify the best machine learning models to predict osteoporosis risk using a balanced dataset.

## About the dataset
The dataset offers comprehensive information on health factors influencing osteoporosis development, including demographic details, lifestyle choices, medical history, and bone health indicators. It aims to facilitate research in osteoporosis prediction, enabling machine learning models to identify individuals at risk. Analyzing factors like age, gender, hormonal changes, and lifestyle habits can help improve osteoporosis management and prevention strategies.

## Methods
### Data Preprocessing
The dataset was carefully prepared to make it suitable for machine learning analysis. Initially, we converted all categorical data into numerical data because machine learning algorithms require numerical input. This conversion was done using a technique called label encoding, which assigns a unique number to each category. After encoding, we checked to ensure the conversion was correct by reviewing the unique values for each column.

Next, we organized the dataset by separating the features (information used for prediction) from the target variable (the outcome we want to predict). We excluded the Id column, as it was just an identifier, and the Osteoporosis column, as it was our target variable. This left us with a set of features (X) and a target variable (y).

To ensure that all the features were on a similar scale, we standardized the data. Standardizing adjusts the values so that they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which can help improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

The prepared data was then split into two parts: one for training the models (80% of the data) and one for testing them (20% of the data). This split helps us evaluate how well our models might perform on new, unseen data. We used a random seed to ensure that the data split was reproducible.

### Model Selection and Evaluation
We evaluated a variety of machine learning models to find the best one for predicting the risk of osteoporosis. The models we tested included Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, HistGradientBoosting, NGBoost, and Support Vector Classifier. Each model has different strengths and characteristics, so it was important to test multiple models.

To compare these models, we used several performance measures: accuracy (how often the model is correct), precision (how many of the positive predictions are actually correct), recall (how many actual positives the model correctly identifies), F1 score (a balance between precision and recall), and AUC-ROC (a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes). We also looked at confusion matrices, which show the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. We also generated ROC curves for each model to visually compare their performance. The results were compiled into a table to provide a clear comparison of each model's strengths and weaknesses.
